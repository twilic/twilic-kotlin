# Contributing

Thank you for improving the Twilic Kotlin/JVM implementation.

## Scope

This repository implements the Twilic wire format and session-aware encoder/decoder. Keep changes aligned with the normative spec in [twilic/twilic](https://github.com/twilic/twilic).

## Development

Implementation code belongs in `src/main/kotlin and src/main/java/io/twilic/internal/core`. Match API naming and behavior of [twilic-python](https://github.com/twilic/twilic-python) and [twilic-java](https://github.com/twilic/twilic-java) where applicable.

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Markdown in this repository is formatted with Prettier and linted with markdownlint (same tooling as [twilic/twilic-go](https://github.com/twilic/twilic-go)):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm format        # write
pnpm format:check  # CI check
pnpm lint          # markdownlint
```

Interop scripts under `scripts/` expect `../twilic-rust` as a sibling clone (or `TWILIC_RUST_ROOT`). Run `bash scripts/check-interop.sh` for JUnit interop tests plus bidirectional Rust smoke checks.
